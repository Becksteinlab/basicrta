Welcome to basicrta's documentation!
=========================================================
``basicrtakit`` is a package to analyze binding kinetics in molecular dynamics 
simulations. The analysis uses an exponential mixture model and Bayesian 
nonparametric inference to determine time-scales of the underlying binding 
processes. The output is processed to give frames belonging to a given process 
with an associated time-scale, which can be further analyzed.
